                        <p>Hi,<br />
                            I'm Wayne, a web developer with over a year of experience building user-centric web applications. I leverage my skills in both front-end and back-end development to deliver projects that are both functional and visually appealing.<br />
                            Over the past year, I've honed my skills in core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've recently expanded my knowledge to include popular frameworks like React, Redux, and React Three Fiber for building dynamic front-end experiences. Additionally, I've delved into back-end development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create robust and scalable applications.<br />
                            My passion for web development extends to user experience (UX) design. I believe in creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces that prioritize user interaction. I utilize tools like Figma to bring prototypes to life, ensuring a strong understanding of user behavior throughout the design process.<br />
                            I'm an active learner and collaborator, and I'm always open to exploring new projects in the web development field. My skillset encompasses both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to tackle projects of varying complexity.
