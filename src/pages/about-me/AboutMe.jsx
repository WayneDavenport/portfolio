                                My name is Wayne and I am a full-stack web developer. I grew up a bit ways south of Houston, and graduated from University of Houston in 2011 with a degree in Hotel & Restaurant Management. After trying my hand in that industry, it decidedly wasn’t for me, so I took up coding so that I could do what I’ve always wanted. Sit at a computer and solve problems creatively. So far on this journey, I’ve learned to build and deploy modern web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with an emphasis on the MERN stack, as well as utilizing libraries such as Three.JS and GSAP for 3D and animated/interactive content.
